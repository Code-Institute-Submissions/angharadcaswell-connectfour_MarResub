# 1. Project Goals
Two players to be able to play Connect Four and for there to be one winner. The game is to be played in the Python Terminal and hosted on Heroku. 

The aim of the game is to be the first to get 4 pieces in a row. The pieces can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. 

##  How to play:
1. Each player enters their name.
2. Player one selects a coloum (0-6) on the board to drop a piece. 
3. The piece will be marked on the board with a "1" or "2" depending on which player's turn it is. 
4. You can not add a piece to a full column. 
5. The players take it in turns to drop their pieces. 
6. The first player to get four in a row wins!!!
